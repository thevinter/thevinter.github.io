---

My name is Nik Vinter and i've been a DM for more than 5 years already. I'm interested in world building, homebrewing and running official Dungeons & Dragons 5E content.

  > In this site you'll find articles, reviews and homebrews for monsters. As well as tools i've developed to help you DMing your games. I hope you stick around and find something useful.

All the material in here is, and will always be free. 

Have fun on my website!
